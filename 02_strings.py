# Python Strings

# can print a string using double quotes or single quotes
# don't need semicolon at the end of a line

message = "Meet me tonight."
print(message)

message2 = 'The clock strikes at midnight.'
print(message2)

# if using single quotes, need escape for apostrophes in the string
message3 = 'I\'m looking for someone to share in an adventure.'
# better way is to just use double quotes
message3 = "I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure."

# if string contains quotation marks, use single quotes to make the string
message4 = 'The phrase "Beam me up, Scotty" was never said on Star Trek.'

# can begin and end a string using triple quotes (three single quotes or three double quotes)
# the triple quotes also allow the string to be split across multiple lines
movie_quote = """One of my favorite lines from  The Godfather is:
"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse." Do you know who said this?"""
