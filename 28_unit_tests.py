# Unit Tests in Python

# Check that the function works properly.
# Typically put the unit tests in a separate file.
# Naming conventions (ex: function in file named circles.py):
# (1) test_circles.py (all the test files will be grouped together)
# (2) circles_test.py (each test file is grouped with its respective file)

# Refer to circles.py and 28_test_circles.py.

# Python has many different "assert" methods for testing.
